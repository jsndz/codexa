Absolutely, Jaison — here’s a **refined README** for your project **Codexa**, filling in the blanks and making it clear, impactful, and developer-friendly.

# 🚀 Codexa – AI-Driven Code Review & Static Analysis GitHub App

Codexa is an intelligent GitHub App written in **JavaScript** that integrates directly into your repository. Once installed, it listens to `push` events and performs **automated static code analysis** enhanced with **LLMs (Large Language Models)** to detect issues, improve code quality, and prevent secrets leakage — all without leaving GitHub.

---

## ✨ What Codexa Does

On every push to a repository where Codexa is installed:

1. 📩 **Receives Code via GitHub Webhook**

   - Listens to `push` events
   - Automatically pulls the latest commits and file diffs

2. 🧠 **Performs Static Code Analysis**

   - Evaluates code complexity
   - Highlights bad patterns, anti-patterns, or structural issues

3. 🔐 **Detects API Keys / Secrets**

   - Scans for common patterns of hardcoded secrets
   - Warns about leaked tokens, credentials, and misconfigurations

4. 🤖 **Uses LLMs for Higher-Order Insights**

   - Leverages an LLM to provide contextual feedback, code smells, and refactor suggestions
   - Offers human-like explanations and improvement tips

5. ✅ **Reports Results via GitHub Checks**

   - Posts inline annotations on commits/files
   - Summarizes issues as Check Run results directly on GitHub UI

---

## 📦 Features

- Works **out-of-the-box** after GitHub App installation
- **Fully automated** — no CLI tools or integrations required
- **Modular analyzer pipeline** (can use regex, ASTs, LLMs)
- Displays all feedback as part of GitHub Checks on commits
- Can be extended to include **pull request summaries**, Slack alerts, etc.

## 🔐 Permissions Required

When creating your GitHub App, request these permissions:

| Permission          | Access Level |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| Repository contents | Read-only    |
| Webhooks            | Push         |
| Checks              | Read & write |
| Metadata            | Read-only    |

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **GitHub API**: [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js)
- **Webhooks Proxy** (local): [Smee.io](https://smee.io/)
- **Static Analysis**: Custom + ESLint + Regex + AST
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI / Local LLMs via API
- **Server**: Express (or built-in Node.js HTTP)

## 🧪 Example Output on GitHub

- ✅ Codexa appears as a GitHub Check on each commit
- 🧵 Click into the check to see:

  - 🧠 LLM-generated advice
  - ⚠️ Secrets or API key warnings
  - ⚙️ Code complexity reports

- 🖊️ Inline annotations show exactly which lines have issues

---

## 🔍 Future Ideas

- PR summary comments with natural language reviews
- Security-focused mode (e.g., OWASP patterns)
- Dashboard to view metrics across repos
- CLI to run Codexa locally (Codexa CLI)

Let me know if you want this converted into a **starter template** with actual working code to begin from. I can also help set up the **LLM integration** logic and **check run output formatting**.
